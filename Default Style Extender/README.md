# Default Style Extender
My main mod.
The current implementation of the style system is underutilized in my opinion. Therefore I have made it my duty to slowly but surely add styles for most, if not all outfits in the game by default.
We're still a long way off from reaching that goal, but I'm doing my best. ðŸ˜…
