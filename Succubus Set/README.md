# Succubus Set
**_IMPORTANT_**
The original outfit pack/set was created by Dex who you can find over on his twitter, [twitter.com/tripledexrated](https://twitter.com/tripledexrated).

I created a addon pack adding different style options to all of his beautifully created outfits because I just really like having options and the ability to customize.

You'll find 3 zip-files for this mod here.
The original by Dex (dex_succubus_set.zip), my addon (smurfyblue_succubus_set_addon.zip) and a combination of the original and my addon, created with permission from Dex (dex_smurfyblue_succubus_set_combined.zip).

## Which do I download?
You have a couple options.
- Just the original.
  - You'll miss out on some sweet options, but you'll preserve the "creators intent"!
- The original + my addon
  - Gives you more options, but is really more of a legacy option.
- The combined version.
  - Same as original + addon content wise, but in one zip and cleaned up a little. That's the only difference!
